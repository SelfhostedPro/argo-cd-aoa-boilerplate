# Apps
This folder stores all of our application templates. These templates refrence folders in our git repo to use for argo-cd deployments. In order to add applications for argo-cd to manage, add their application manifest to the templates folder and add a refrence to them in the kustomization.yaml in this directory. The manifests and deployments should be placed in the kustom folder at the root of this repository. If you're looking to add another type of project (helm, jsonnet, etc.) create a new folder for them in the root of this repo so we can better track where apps are located.
